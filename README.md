# Leetcode Solutions

This is a repository that contains the leetcode solutions I have coded.
I tend to use scripting languages to do my work, as I can show the work,
and comment about changes in real time.  Compiled languages tend to be a
bit more restrictive for such purposes.

As I get time, I will add more optimizations to the code, which you will
be able to see in the code repository history.

Where possible, I use brute force to solve problems, if it makes sense.
I also use more elegant solutions as I have time to go back over code
and make appropriate changes.

I'm open to suggestions, criticism, or anything else.  If you are
interested in offering better solutions, please feel free to submit a
pull request!
